Wikipedia Suggestions
=====================

In this exercise you will develop a reactive graphical user interface for the Wikipedia Suggestions application.
This application will allow the user to enter a search term and in real time render a list of possible completions
of that search term from Wikipedia.
After that, a user will be able to select one of the suggested terms and click `Get`, which will render the desired wikipedia page.


## Observable extensions

TODO The event to observable pattern.


## Wikipedia suggestion utilities

TODO implementing common utilities, nicely factored out so that they can be tested separately.


## Putting it all together

TODO completing the main application.
